#Unit 2.1: Java and Math#

This unit introduces variables and arithmetic operations in Java. Below are answers to selected unit questions.

Question 1: What is the value of each expression after it is evaluated?  If the statement is an error, write Syntax Error.
a.  1 / 4 = 0
b.  4.0 / 2 = 2.0
c.  1.0 / 4 = 0.25
d.  int x = 4.0 / 2, Syntax Error
e.  double x = 1 / 4 = 0.0

Question 2: Rewrite double y = 1 / 3 so that it evaluates to 0.3333333.
double y = 1.0 / 3

Question 3: What is the value of x after each expression?  If the statement is an error, write Syntax Error.
a.  int x = (int) 4.999, x = 4
b   double x = (int) 0.999, x = 0.0
c.  int x = (double) 8, Syntax Error
d.  int x = (int) 4.999 / (int) 2.5, x = 2
e.  int x = (int) (4.5 / 0.9), x = 5
