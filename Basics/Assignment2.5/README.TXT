Question 1: What output is printed to the terminal when singOldMacdonald (shown in the notes) is invoked?

Old MacDonald had a farm, EE-I-EE-I-O,
And on that farm he had a cow, EE-I-EE-I-O,
With a moo moo here and a moo moo there
Here a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moo moo
Old MacDonald had a farm, EE-I-EE-I-O.

Old MacDonald had a farm, EE-I-EE-I-O,
And on that farm he had a dog, EE-I-EE-I-O,
With a woof woof here and a woof woof there
Here a woof, there a woof, everywhere a woof woof
Old MacDonald had a farm, EE-I-EE-I-O.

Question 2: How would you invoke the verse method if you wanted to sing about a duck that quacks?

verse("duck", "quack");

Question 3: What is the output of the following program (shown in the notes)?
            Be precise about where there are spaces and where there are new lines.
            Hint: Start by describing in words what ping() and baffle() do when they are invoked.

When invoked, ping() prints "." while baffle() prints "wug" and invokes ping().

No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.

Question 4: Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the first time ping() is invoked.

 ----------------------
| ping()               |
 ----------------------
| baffle()             |
 ----------------------
| zoop()               |
 ----------------------
| main (String[] args) |
 ----------------------
